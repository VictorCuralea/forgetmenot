I need all distinct characters that appear in a column in a mysql table, sorted asc

To get all distinct characters in a specific column sorted in ascending order, you can use the following query. This query uses a combination of SUBSTRING and GROUP_CONCAT functions. Please replace your_table_name and your_column_name with the actual table and column names:

``SET SESSION group_concat_max_len = 1000000;

SELECT GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT one_char ORDER BY one_char ASC) AS all_distinct_chars
FROM (
  SELECT DISTINCT SUBSTRING(your_column_name, pos, 1) AS one_char
  FROM your_table_name
  JOIN (
    SELECT 1 AS pos
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 2 UNION ALL SELECT 3 UNION ALL SELECT 4 UNION ALL SELECT 5
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 6 UNION ALL SELECT 7 UNION ALL SELECT 8 UNION ALL SELECT 9
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 10 UNION ALL SELECT 11 UNION ALL SELECT 12 UNION ALL SELECT 13
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 14 UNION ALL SELECT 15 UNION ALL SELECT 16 UNION ALL SELECT 17
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 18 UNION ALL SELECT 19 UNION ALL SELECT 20 UNION ALL SELECT 21
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 22 UNION ALL SELECT 23 UNION ALL SELECT 24 UNION ALL SELECT 25
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 26 UNION ALL SELECT 27 UNION ALL SELECT 28 UNION ALL SELECT 29
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 30 -- Add more numbers if you expect column values to be longer
  ) AS positions
  WHERE pos <= CHAR_LENGTH(your_column_name)
) AS subquery;
